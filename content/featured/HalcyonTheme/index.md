This [Freelancing webApp] project is my [First] project which took [10hrs] per/day for [28 dyas]. Created a platform that connects freelancers and clients directly, freelancers to sell their services & skills online, and for clients to hire freelancers with minimum bids.
 Basically This app contains 2 panels for [Freelancer], and for [users].
